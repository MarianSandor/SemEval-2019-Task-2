# SemEval 2019 Unsupervised Lexical Semantic Frame Induction Task
My approach for solving Task 2 from SemEval 2019 competition

## Description
Lexical Frame Induction is defined as the process of grouping verbs and their dependant words in type-feature structures (i.e. frames) in a fully unsupervised manner. The Berkeley FrameNet database is the most well known resource of such typed-feature structures. While lexical frame resources are proved to be helpful (even essential) in a range of NLP tasks and linguistics investigations, building them for new languages and domains is resource intensive and thus expensive. This problem can be alleviated using unsupervised lexical frame induction methods. The goal of this task is to develop a benchmark and allow comparison of unsupervised frame induction systems for building lexical frame resources for verbs and their arguments.
